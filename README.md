# 🏋️ Tech Debt Workout
**A Legacy C# WinForms Refactoring Challenge**

---

## 📖 Overview
This repository contains a **purposefully poorly designed** Windows Forms application for managing contact information. The app is filled with **anti-patterns, bugs, and technical debt**.

**Your Goal**: Analyze the codebase, identify problematic areas, and refactor it into something clean, maintainable, and robust—**without breaking existing functionality**.

---

## 🛠️ Tasks
### 1. **Review the Solution**
   - Explore the codebase in `/BadCSharpApp`.
   - Identify **poor practices**, **code smells**, and **maintainability issues**.
   - Document your findings.

### 2. **Refactor the Code**
   - Apply best practices to improve the codebase.
   - Focus on:
     - Readability
     - Maintainability
     - Correctness
   - Ensure the application **remains functional** after your changes.

### 3. **Document Your Work**
   - Add **comments** to explain the changes made.
   - Describe **how you would test** the application to verify your improvements.
   - Summarize your findings and rationale in `FINDINGS.md`.

---

## 📋 Evaluation Criteria
You’ll be evaluated on your ability to:
- **Identify and explain** areas for improvement.
- **Refactor effectively** with clean, maintainable code.
- **Preserve functionality** while fixing issues.
- **Document your decisions** clearly.

---

## 🎯 Rules
- Do **not** alter the core functionality of the application.
- Prioritize **code quality** and **readability**.
- Assume this is **production code**—make it robust and future-proof.

## 📨 Submission
- Share your completed code with us as a zip file using a file sharing service (eg: [Wormhole](https://wormhole.app/))

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
This project is **intentionally flawed** and designed as a basic refactoring exercise. It is **not** representative of real-world production code.

**Good luck!** 🚀
